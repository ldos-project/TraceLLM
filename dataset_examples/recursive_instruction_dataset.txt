num_current_edges is over the threshold, so split the subgraph instructions into smaller subgraph instructions
for all subgraph instructions, start_communication_at <= latency
for all subgraph instructions, latency should not be larger than the requirement's latency
When splitting the subgraph instructions, copy start_node:MS_53473 from the requirement
