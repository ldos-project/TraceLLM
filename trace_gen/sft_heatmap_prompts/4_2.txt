the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 19 milliseconds
### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
remaining_depth:1/num_edges:4/id:S_025441149/num_current_edges:1/start_communication_at:0/num_subgraphs:1/start_node:USER
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
Build a call graph with latencies based on distributions
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER

Also, communication should finish before latency 2 milliseconds
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 2 milliseconds
