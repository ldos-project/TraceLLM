### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
id:S_106290614/start_node:USER/num_edges:14/num_subgraphs:1/start_communication_at:0/start_edge_id:0/num_current_edges:1/remaining_depth:4
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
Build a call graph with latencies based on distributions
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
