### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
id:S_070962240/num_current_edges:1/start_node:USER/num_edges:7/remaining_depth:4/start_edge_id:0/start_communication_at:0
Conditions:
Generate subgraph instructions if necessary
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER

Conditions:
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 6 milliseconds
Also, communication should finish before latency 6 milliseconds
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
