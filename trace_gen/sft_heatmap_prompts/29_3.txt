### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_node:USER/num_subgraphs:1/latency:8504/start_communication_at:0/remaining_depth:2/id:S_036816397/num_edges:29/start_edge_id:0/num_current_edges:1
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
Also, communication should finish before latency 8504 milliseconds
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:

Conditions:
Also, communication should finish before latency 11964 milliseconds
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 11964 milliseconds
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
