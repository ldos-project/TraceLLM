### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_node:USER/num_current_edges:1/num_edges:8/start_communication_at:0/id:S_011997202/num_subgraphs:1/remaining_depth:5
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
Build a call graph with latencies based on distributions
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_edge_id:0/start_node:USER/latency:33/remaining_depth:5/id:S_025464072/num_edges:8/start_communication_at:0/num_current_edges:1
Conditions:
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 33 milliseconds
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
Also, communication should finish before latency 33 milliseconds
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
remaining_depth:5/latency:2622/num_edges:8/id:S_001823657/start_communication_at:0/start_edge_id:0/start_node:USER/num_subgraphs:1/num_current_edges:1
Conditions:
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
Also, communication should finish before latency 2622 milliseconds
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 2622 milliseconds
