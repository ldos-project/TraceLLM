id:S_097880693/num_current_edges:1/start_node:USER/remaining_depth:1/num_edges:19/start_communication_at:0/start_edge_id:0/num_subgraphs:1
Conditions:
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_node:USER/remaining_depth:1/num_current_edges:1/num_subgraphs:1/start_communication_at:0/num_edges:19/latency:5/id:S_097880693
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 5 milliseconds
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
Also, communication should finish before latency 5 milliseconds
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
