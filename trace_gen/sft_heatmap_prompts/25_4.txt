start_edge_id:0/num_subgraphs:1/remaining_depth:3/num_edges:25/start_node:USER/num_current_edges:1/id:S_135494150/start_communication_at:0/latency:29
Conditions:
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
Also, communication should finish before latency 29 milliseconds
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 29 milliseconds
