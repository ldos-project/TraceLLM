### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_node:USER/start_communication_at:0/latency:260/num_subgraphs:1/start_edge_id:0/remaining_depth:4/id:S_130841691/num_edges:19
Conditions:
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
Also, communication should finish before latency 260 milliseconds
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 260 milliseconds
