### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_node:USER/num_subgraphs:1/num_current_edges:1/id:S_106290614/start_communication_at:0/remaining_depth:5/start_edge_id:0/latency:18/num_edges:12
Conditions:
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
Also, communication should finish before latency 18 milliseconds
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 18 milliseconds
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
