### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_edge_id:0/id:S_163769826/num_edges:14/remaining_depth:5/num_current_edges:1/start_communication_at:0/start_node:USER/num_subgraphs:1
Conditions:
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
Build a call graph with latencies based on distributions
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_edge_id:0/num_subgraphs:1/remaining_depth:5/id:S_021874676/start_communication_at:0/num_current_edges:1/start_node:USER/latency:220/num_edges:14
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
Also, communication should finish before latency 220 milliseconds
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 220 milliseconds
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
