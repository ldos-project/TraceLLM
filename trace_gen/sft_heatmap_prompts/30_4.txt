### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
num_current_edges:1/start_communication_at:0/remaining_depth:3/start_node:USER/start_edge_id:0/id:S_025464072/latency:26/num_edges:30
Conditions:
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 26 milliseconds
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
remaining_depth:3/latency:53/start_communication_at:0/start_node:USER/start_edge_id:0/num_edges:30/num_subgraphs:1/num_current_edges:1/id:S_023072070
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
Also, communication should finish before latency 53 milliseconds
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER

Conditions:
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
Build a call graph with latencies based on distributions
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time

Include an edge from USER to MS_39246 with http type
Also, communication should finish before latency 39 milliseconds
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 39 milliseconds
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
