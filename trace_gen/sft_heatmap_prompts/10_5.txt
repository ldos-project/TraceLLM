### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_communication_at:0/num_subgraphs:1/num_edges:10/start_node:USER/id:S_007209258/remaining_depth:4
Conditions:
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER

Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
Also, communication should finish before latency 21 milliseconds
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 21 milliseconds
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
