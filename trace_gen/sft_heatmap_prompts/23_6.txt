### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_communication_at:0/id:S_163769826/num_current_edges:1/start_node:USER/num_subgraphs:1/num_edges:23/remaining_depth:5
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
