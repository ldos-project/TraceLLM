num_subgraphs:1/id:S_036816397/remaining_depth:1/start_edge_id:0/latency:8778/start_node:USER/num_edges:23
Conditions:
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 8778 milliseconds
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
