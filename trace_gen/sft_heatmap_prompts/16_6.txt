### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_node:USER/num_subgraphs:1/num_current_edges:1/id:S_048212960/num_edges:16/start_communication_at:0/start_edge_id:0/latency:24/remaining_depth:5
Conditions:
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 24 milliseconds
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
Also, communication should finish before latency 24 milliseconds
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
