### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_communication_at:0/num_subgraphs:1/start_edge_id:0/start_node:USER/latency:18/remaining_depth:2/num_current_edges:1/id:S_108684358/num_edges:23
Conditions:
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
Also, communication should finish before latency 18 milliseconds
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 18 milliseconds
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
