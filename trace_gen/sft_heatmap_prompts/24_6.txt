### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
id:S_041625275/num_subgraphs:1/num_current_edges:1/latency:91/start_edge_id:0/start_node:USER/num_edges:24/start_communication_at:0/remaining_depth:5
Conditions:
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
Also, communication should finish before latency 91 milliseconds
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 91 milliseconds
