### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_edge_id:0/latency:206/start_communication_at:0/start_node:USER/num_edges:7/num_subgraphs:1/id:S_159578143/num_current_edges:1/remaining_depth:5
Conditions:
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 206 milliseconds
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
Also, communication should finish before latency 206 milliseconds
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
