### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
latency:36/num_edges:27/start_communication_at:0/id:S_072758179/remaining_depth:5/num_current_edges:1/num_subgraphs:1/start_node:USER/start_edge_id:0
Conditions:
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 36 milliseconds
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0

In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 39 milliseconds
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
Also, communication should finish before latency 39 milliseconds
