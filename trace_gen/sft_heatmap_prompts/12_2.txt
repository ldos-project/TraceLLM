copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
### Question: You are a trace generator that creates traces based on given requirements.
Requirements:
start_communication_at:0/latency:2314/start_edge_id:0/start_node:USER/num_subgraphs:1/num_edges:12/num_current_edges:1/id:S_036816397/remaining_depth:1
Conditions:
the first start_communication_at should be requirement's start_communication_at 0
the first edge_id should be start_edge_id 0
In each edge, communication start time should NOT be greater than latency 2314 milliseconds
copy caller from requirement's start_node:USER
Also, communication should finish before latency 2314 milliseconds
generate 1 edges following num_current_edges
for all edges, communication start time <= communication finish time
